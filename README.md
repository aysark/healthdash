# HealthDash

# Overview
HealthDash helps care teams suffering from data silos, with real-time data to improve situational awareness. HealthDash takes real-time data from disparate providers via CDS Hooks, visually displays it in a Kanban-style scheduler, and supercharges that with machine learning to calculate a readmission risk factor. HealthDash uses a lot of tech on the backend but is extremely simple from the user's point of view -- it's like a conduit from the disconnected providers to the Primary care team.
